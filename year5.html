                <h2>The Story of Year 5</h2>
                <pre>
In our fifth year, the final stretch began,
Long distance lingered, but we held to our plan.
With miles between us, our love stayed strong,
Dreaming of the day when we'd no longer be long.

Ron's career blossomed, steps taken with care,
While Romi's business soared, reaching new heights so rare.
We traveled our paths, exploring new lands,
Ron in Asia, Romi in Europe's hands.

Yet amidst it all, we found our way,
To Florida, Boston, New Yorkâ€”where our hearts would stay.
Visits cherished, moments we'd steal,
Keeping our connection vibrant and real.

Serious decisions began to arise,
Plans aligning, love in our eyes.
Through each conversation, our bond grew tight,
Our love solidified, strong and bright.

Still, we laughed, we played, we held on tight,
Keeping the spark alive in the quiet of night.
In this final stretch, we grew and we learned,
That love like ours is something truly earned.

So here's to year five, the end of the wait,
As we prepare for the next step, embracing our fate.
Through distance, growth, and moments apart,
We've built a future, strong in heart.
