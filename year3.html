                <h2>The Story of Year 3</h2>
                <pre>
In our final college year, a chapter's end drew near, 
A journey of love, memories held dear. 
Embracing the familiar, our favorite spots in sight,
Halo, Luke's, concerts - moments shining bright.

Bars and lakes echoed with laughter and cheer, 
We savored these days, drawing them near. 
The last ride we took, a journey complete, 
In the heart of togetherness, our bond replete.

As one chapter closed, another began to rise, 
Facing the world with wide-open eyes. 
Together we stood, as a chapter we sealed, 
A moment of transition, a love that's revealed.

An international adventure, a new frontier, 
Hand in hand, we embarked without fear. 
New cultures, new horizons, side by side, 
In the vast expanse of the world, our love amplified.

This year marked a choice, a decision so bold, 
To keep the flames of love steadfastly strolled. 
Long distance lay ahead, a challenge untamed, 
Yet our hearts remained united, love unconstrained.

Through miles and moments, time zones apart, 
Our love defied distance, a beat of the heart. 
A pursuit continued, a promise held true, 
In the face of challenges, our love grew.

Year three's tale, a tapestry divine, 
Weaving love's threads, a story so fine. 
From college's embrace to futures anew, 
Our hearts entwined, love's journey we'd pursue.

As we tread through life's intricate maze, 
Our love, unyielding, continues to blaze. 
Hand in hand, no matter the road we tread, 
In the story of us, love's light is spread.
