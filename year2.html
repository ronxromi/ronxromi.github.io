                <h2>Our Poem</h2>
                <pre>
As COVID's grip began to wane its hold, 
A new chapter in our love story unfolded. 
With partners by our sides, we ventured forth, 
Embracing normalcy, the world's beauty and worth.

To Gainesville we journeyed, hearts aligned, 
Sharing an apartment, a life intertwined. 
Hand in hand, in our love's sweet dance,
Creating a haven, a true romance.

Our first trip together, an adventure anew, 
Exploring the world, just me and you. 
Concerts that echoed with melodies bold, 
Moments cherished, memories untold.

Amidst nature's embrace, we found delight,
Camping trips under stars so bright. 
In the heart of the wild, side by side, 
Our love's flame burned ever so wide.

An intern's role, a budding business's grace, 
This year, new challenges we would embrace. 
As you strove to legitimize dreams so bold, 
And I embarked on a journey, untold.

From youthful love to a team mature, 
Navigating life's waters, we'd endure. 
The dawn of adulthood, a path we tread, 
Hand in hand, where dreams are spread.

Through every exploration, a journey anew, 
Our love's foundation ever true. 
Supporting, growing, side by side, 
In the tapestry of us, love does abide.

So here's to the second year, a chapter we share, 
A love that deepens, a journey so rare. 
As we stride into the future, strong and brave, 
Our hearts, entwined, the love we'll save.
