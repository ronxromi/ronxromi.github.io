            <h2>Our Poem</h2>
            <pre>
In the realm of UF, our journey took flight,
A chance encounter that felt so right.
She sought out her twin, a brother's care,
But fate intervened, love was in the air.

Bonds formed in the shadow of care,
Laughter and friendship, a duo so rare.
In the tin house's embrace, we'd often meet,
Watching shows, sharing tales, making memories sweet.

As summer's end drew near, a truth unveiled,
Emotions blossomed, the path ahead detailed.
A serious friendship had paved the way,
For something deeper, a love's gentle sway.

Amid uncertainties, doubts did arise,
Jack's reservations, a challenge in disguise.
But our hearts entwined, a force so strong,
Love's sweet melody, an irresistible song.

Adventures beckoned, a world to explore,
Hand in hand, through an open door.
As a pandemic's shadow cast its veil,
Together we weathered, our love set to sail.

On a cruise through the waves, under starry skies,
Side by side, our spirits would rise.
Families met, a merging of lives,
Building foundations, where love thrives.

Laughter echoed through days and nights,
Love's canvas painted with vivid lights.
Through challenges faced and joys that bloomed,
In that first year, our hearts fully consumed.

Romi and Ron, a tale worth to tell,
A journey of love, where two hearts dwell.
Through every twist and turn we'd find,
A love so enduring, intertwining and kind.

So here's to the first year, a chapter so grand,
In love's enchanting embrace, hand in hand.
With memories woven, our hearts grew strong,
In the tapestry of us, where we belong.
