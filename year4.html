                <h2>The Story of Year 4</h2>
                <pre>
Into our fourth year, a journey anew, 
A chapter of growth, for me and for you. 
From the heart of adulthood, we carried on, 
Navigating changes from dusk until dawn.

Fresh job horizons for one, Boston's embrace, 
For another, a business, a dream to chase. 
United we stood, side by side we'd stride, 
Embracing the challenges, facing the tide.

Long-distance revisited, lessons to learn, 
Through miles and screens, our love would discern. 
As we grew personally, our bond held strong, 
Distance couldn't diminish the love we'd prolong.

In the midst of it all, a change discreet, 
A transformation that made our love complete. 
Romi's subtle shift, a confidence bloom, 
A change not just in appearance, but in the room.

As travelers, we soared to exciting heights, 
Exploring new lands, embracing the sights. 
Shared adventures, memories anew, 
In the tapestry of us, love ever true.

Lessons etched into the fabric of time, 
Growth intertwined, like a rhythmic rhyme. 
Emotionally fortified, personally evolved, 
Our love's story, steadily solved.

Through every twist and every turn, 
In each challenge faced, we'd discern. 
Our love's depth, like roots in the earth,
A constant reminder of our incredible worth.

So here's to the fourth year, a chapter of grace, 
A love that flourished, finding its place. 
As we journey forward, hand in hand, 
Our love, an unbreakable strand.
